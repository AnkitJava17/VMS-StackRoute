# Introduction
- Vehicle Management System
- The purpose of the Vehicle Management System is to provide a platform where users can search for bike 
sharing, car sharing, and car rental services. This system will also facilitate truck drivers in dividing their 
trips with interstate drivers, allowing them to spend more time with their families


##  :beginner: About
- API is an abbreviation for Application Programming Interface which is a collection of communication protocols and subroutines used by various programs to
communicate between them, an API helps two programs or applications to communicate with each other by providing them with necessary tools and functions.
It takes the request from the user and sends it to the service provider and then again sends the result generated from the service provider to the desired user.


## :zap: Usage
One of the top reasons developers use APIs is to integrate one system with another system.
Adding or enhancing functionality for customers
APIs can help improve software and system testing by allowing quality engineering teams to separate tests for frontend components, the parts of software that users see, from tests for backend components, the parts of software that users donâ€™t see.

###  :electric_plug: Installation
- Steps on how to install this project, to use it.
- This project was done on Springboot (It is an open source, microservice-based Java web framework)
- Starting with the installation (step by step, nothing complex)
- Using Spring Initializer generating the structure of the project. Like name of the project, adding dependencies and setting the version.
- Installing MySQL as we are working with the mySql to store and fetch our data.
- Adding a properties file where we set the connection status to the mySql.
- Installing Postman is must as we need to test our API

###  :nut_and_bolt: Development Environment
- Dependencies can be set while starting the project in spring initializer phase although if you miss any of the dependency, these can be further added in pom file which stores all the dependencies. When we initialize the spring it already provides us a pom file.
- This project is done using maven so the structure is to be followed while adding dependencies.
